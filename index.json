Mostafa recaped previous tasks with katherine, and showed her how to use group\u0026rsquo;s wiki and submit answers to tasks. Katherine had completed exercises of chapter 1, and expressed they were too easy. Mostafa asked Katherine to typeset her solutions and share them with the group on wiki. Katherine expressed her lack of having friends with whom she jokes about science. However, she seemed delighted about what social media is offering. Mostafa showed super collaboration by Erik Demaine to Katherine, and wished if the group collaborated on something similar to it. Mostafa suggested wolfram\u0026rsquo;s computational model of universe to Katherine, To present for other members. Mostafa showed Katherine Hanabi game. Mostafa called-out for assistants, to support him in organizing this group. Kathering pointed-out members will be willing to help. Mostafa ended-up the meeting, Wishing for all members to participate and express themselves, In order to have more meaningful interaction.   Plus Meeting (1) (09/04/2022) Links\n Audio  Objectives\n Ensure members understand the logistical way of participation and tasks\u0026rsquo; solution submission. Discuss members\u0026rsquo; suggestions of problems, investigations, or projects, to be pursued by the study group. Discuss each member\u0026rsquo;s personal goals and plans.  Summary\n Dylan Sheils Introduced himself. He is an undergrad student, Majored in physics and computer science, at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute university, in New York. He is interested in understanding theory of computing using physics. Had collaborative projects in universities but they didn\u0026rsquo;t go well. He had completed an introductory course on quantum computing and implemented a circuit simulator project. He\u0026rsquo;s looking more for advanced topics in quantum computing, and physics simulation. Mostafa racaped the group\u0026rsquo;s previous tasks. Namely, (1) Suggesting materials and exercises for quantum computing, Through pure physics and hardware perspectives. (2) Members submission of their own interesting problems. (3) Members feedback on group\u0026rsquo;s logistics and suggestions for improvement. Joseph had done some quantum programming, but didn\u0026rsquo;t study quantum information or quantum error correction. Mostafa suggested coffee chats meetings, For random discussions. The goal is to booster members social relationships. Boomer, Dylan, and Joseph had agreed. Mostafa stressed members must communicate themselves, in order for the group to evolve. He illustrated the variety of activities the group might tackle altogether, including solving problems collaboratively on a live meeting, playing multiplayer games like Hanabi, and Presentation meetings where a member presents some topic in an accessible manner.  Quotes\n Joseph: \u0026ldquo;A reason why am I discussing this, is that I need to know where others are standing\u0026rdquo;. Mostafa: \u0026ldquo;This is group is gradually going to evolve, but you must express yourself\u0026rdquo;.   Bi-weekly Meeting (02/04/2022) Summary\nMostafa, The organizer faced a technical issue, and wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to participate with other eight members who joined the meeting. It was an embarrassment for him. Two plus meetings are initaited, as a compensation.\n Bi-weekly Meeting (19/03/2022) Links\n Audio  Objectives\n Social Gathering. Members get introduced to each other, Learning about each other\u0026rsquo;s background, interests, and goals. Casual Discussion. Challenges of online study groups and how to overcome them.  Summary\n Aaditya is a sophomore electric engineering student; From india. He has been doing courses in quantum computing and linear algebra; Studied deutsch-jozsa algorithm. He is interested in quantum hardware and error-correction. He had joined a study group before but it\u0026rsquo;s dead now. The problem of it was lack of interaction and discussions. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t follow-up content. Katherine has a bachelor in physics and math; From USA. She has no previous exposure to quantum computing, but took undergrad courses in quantum mechanics. She is interested in physical systems and molecules simulation, and wishes to get exposed to quantum computing\u0026rsquo;s applications as well. Rajesh is employed in the software industry; From india; Graduated from Mumbai university. He read quantum computing for everyone book. His interest is mainly in quantum programming and quantum frameworks. He struggled with math and physics. Ethan is a CS student; interested in math and CS, algorithm design, and theoretical CS. He likes the paradigm shift of quantum computing. He is interested also in philosopy of science. He had no previous experience in study groups. Ethan and Mostafa talked a little bit about philosophy, Theoretical CS, and Chi-ning\u0026rsquo;s mini-course, What is Computation? Rajesh asked about post-meetings document. Mostafa explained it is for those who couldn\u0026rsquo;t attend the meeting, To answer questions Mostafa asked attendees during the live meeting. Members are going to self-study on their own, and the next meeting, Each member is going to share his studying approach. The goal is to establish a good communication among members.   Intro (15/03/2022) Links\n Video Slides  Objectives\n Communicate group\u0026rsquo;s pedagogy, Including motivation, goals, activities, challenges, and how we\u0026rsquo;re going to get started.
