Summary\n Aaditya is a sophomore electric engineering student; From india. He has been doing courses in quantum computing and linear algebra; Studied deutsch-jozsa algorithm. He is interested in quantum hardware and error-correction. He had joined a study group before but it\u0026rsquo;s dead now. The problem of it was lack of interaction and discussions. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t follow-up content. Katherine has a bachelor in physics and math; From USA. She has no previous exposure to quantum computing, but took undergrad courses in quantum mechanics. She is interested in physical systems and molecules simulation, and wishes to get exposed to quantum computing\u0026rsquo;s applications as well. Rajesh is employed in the software industry; From india; Graduated from Mumbai university. He read quantum computing for everyone book. His interest is mainly in quantum programming and quantum frameworks. He struggled with math and physics. Ethan is a CS student; interested in math and CS, algorithm design, and theoretical CS. He likes the paradigm shift of quantum computing. He is interested also in philosopy of science. He had no previous experience in study groups. Ethan and Mostafa talked a little bit about philosophy, Theoretical CS, and Chi-ning\u0026rsquo;s mini-course, What is Computation? Rajesh asked about post-meetings document. Mostafa explained it is for those who couldn\u0026rsquo;t attend the meeting, To answer questions Mostafa asked attendees during the live meeting. Members are going to self-study on their own, and the next meeting, Each member is going to share his studying approach. The goal is to establish a good communication among members.   Intro (15/03/2022) Links\n Video Slides  Objectives\n Communicate group\u0026rsquo;s pedagogy, Including motivation, goals, activities, challenges, and how we\u0026rsquo;re going to get started.
